        <p id="firstparagraph">I graduated from Georgia College and State Univeristy in May 2018 with majors in Finance and Management. Directly after college I got married to my amazing wife Bayley. We have been dating since junior year of high school and I knew she was always the one. Luckily she graduated from Georgia Tech and has a well paying job which allows to take time off from work and come do this program!</p>
        <p>I currently work at a technology company called Clutch Technologies. We specialize in automobile subscription and use our program to perfectly match members with the perfect car for their situation. I would love to be able to help out the development team and understand what they are doing which is why I am so excited about this program!</p>
        <p>My hobbies mainly include watching, betting, and playing sports for the most part. I also love reading in my spare time and watching netflix shows. Currently my favorite shows are Parks and Rec as well as Daredevil.</p>
